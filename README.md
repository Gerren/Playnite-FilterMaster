# Playnite-FilterMaster
Shoveling through piles and piles of games? Cannot find a game you're looking for? This [Playinte](https://playnite.link/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/)) extension will help you.

This extension is heavily inspired by the filtering system found in [Steam library filters](https://www.lorenzostanco.com/lab/steam/) by Lorenzo Stanco. This extension allows you to add conditions and their negations, and in doing so it narrows down your endless collection of games.

## Features:
* It allows much more than the built-in system of filters
* It allows you to filter by mutliple game fields
* It shows all possible values valid for current selection, and grays out the absent ones.
* You can specify, that a value shouldn't be present in a game (example: I do not want any Shooter)
* You can either use your abundant library in its entirety, or use your filters

### Disclaimer
The extension works best when the metadata of your games are well maintained. I strongly recommend puting your library together using Lacro59's [LibraryManager](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-librarymanagement-plugin)
